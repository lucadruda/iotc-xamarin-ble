#Xamarin IoTCentral Mobile Gateway

IoTCentral Mobile Gateway is a mobile application written in Xamarin.Forms that allows people connecting devices to Azure IoTCentral. It currently supports provisioning of WiFi (e.g. MXCHIP) and Bluetooth Low Energy devices.
WiFi capable devices can use a “quick pairing” mode to associate with an application without the need of complex procedures that involve web browsers and manual operations.
BLE devices with no internet connection capability can be provisioned and connected to IoTCentral and also managed from the mobile application itself.
User can map telemetry fields to bluetooth characteristics exposed by the physical device.
